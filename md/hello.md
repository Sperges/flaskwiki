# Additional Notes

**Rest time:** If 90 seconds is not enough, you can rest up to 3 minutes if you like.

**Tempo:** Ideally, all these exercises are to be done in a "10X0" (1,0,X,O)  tempo. That means 1 second down, no (0) pause at the bottom, explode up (X) and no pause (0) at the top. When "exploding up", if the actual movement is slow, that's okay, it's the intent that matters.

Overall, if your pull-up max is say 8 reps, then go for one rep short of failure such as 7-7-7 instead of 8-6-5. The key is to not work at failure for the first set or two because it significantly detracts from performance in later sets which reduces your ability to perform good reps and maximize volume to get stronger and bigger muscles. The 90 second pairing is so that there is minimum 3 minutes rest between each set, which is 3 minutes total. This rest time is where there is 99% replenishment of ATP in the muscles, so you are not limited by fatigue in the muscles. Sticking with failure-1 repetitions and 3 total minutes between sets of the same exercise allows you to maximize volume and effort level which is essential for strength and hypertrophy.

# Learning Concepts

## What are Progressions?

**A progression is a list of exercises from easier-to-harder which target the same general muscle groups.** Instead of adding more weight on each successive workout (like in traditional weightlifiting), you instead add more reps or "level up" the exercise in the progression to make that movement harder.

**Perform the hardest exercise in each progression that you can do for 3 sets of 5 to 8 repetitions.** Progression exercises are there to help you be able to do exercises you cannot currently do because they are too difficult (for example, if you cannot do a push-up, you will be doing wall push-ups or incline push-ups).

**Try to beat your previous numbers every workout.** When you hit 3 sets of 8 reps with good form, move to the next exercise in the progression and start the next workout with 3 sets of 5 reps again.

**You only perform *one* of the exercises from each of the listed progressions in each session.** Once you move up in the progression, there's no need to keep the easier exercises in your routine (except for using it as a warm-up if you feel like it).

Some of the exercises are static holds, such as the support holds or the "tuck front lever" in the rowing progression. Instead of dynamic reps, one set here consists of simply holding the position statically for 10-30 seconds. Move on to the next harder progression once you hit 30 seconds for all 3 sets.

You'll see there are multiple "progression paths" for the exercises. However, don't overthink this - if you're not sure pick the main progression and do it. If for some reason you can't follow the main progression (lack of specific equipment, for example) then pick one of the alternatives and do it.

## What are Pairs?

Pairs are sets of exercises combined together by switching after every set instead of doing 3 sets of 1 exercise, and then 3 sets of another. This saves overall time.

## Integrating Barbell Squats and Deadlifts

 The basic process works as follows:

 * You replace the squat progression by *squats*, 3 sets of 5 repetitions.
 * The 1st and 3rd workout of the week, you replace the hinge progression by *romanian deadlifts (weighted)*, 3 set of 8 repetitions.
 * The 2nd workout of the week, you replace the hinge progression by *deadlifts*, 3 sets of 5 repetitions.

      So every week, you will be squatting thrice, romanian deadlifting twice, and deadlifting once

      Before you do your "work sets" it's a good idea to warm up with less weight for squats and deadlifts: first do a bunch of reps with just the bar, then add weight and do another (slightly smaller) bunch of reps, then add more weight and do another (smaller still) bunch of reps, etc. until you are at the weight you want to be squatting at.

     As for actually selecting a weight: the first time, start with just the bar. Then add weights in increments you feel comfortable with. Try to add some weight every workout at first.
